<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Here is **Songning Lai (ËµñÈ¢ÇÂÆÅ)**.( You can call me Sony. )

I am a junior student studying in the School of Information Science and Engineering([**Chongxin College**](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B1%B1%E4%B8%9C%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E5%B4%87%E6%96%B0%E5%AD%A6%E5%A0%82/20809738?fr=aladdin)), [**Shandong University**](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/) in China,supervised by Prof. [**Zhi Liu**](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/liuzhi1/zh_CN/index.htm). I am also an incoming PhD student at HKUST@AI Thrust&INFO Hub, supervised by Prof. Yutao Yue.

My research interests are **Explainable AI (XAI)** and **Privacy-preserving AI**. Specifically, my research goal is to build faithful XAI systems which are easily understood by users and are robust in various environments (e.g. **XAI4LLM, XAI4NLP, XAI4MM, XAI4CV, XAI4Security** and so on). I am also interested in applying the XAI to real-world scenarios (e.g. optical systems, recommender systems, and traffic forecasting etc.). At the same time, I am also very interested in the research of AI in the field of **astronomy, environmental science, materials and medicine**.

Prior to this, I have also been exposed to bioinformatics, multimodal sentiment analysis, domain generalization and other research areas.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *songninglai[at]hkust-gz[dot]edu[dot]cn*.

**[Towards Multi-dimensional Explanation Alignment for Medical Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21494)**
  
Lijie Hu#, Songning Lai#, **Wenshuo Chen#**, Hongru Xiao, Hongbin Lin, Lu Yu, Jingfeng Zhang, and Di Wang
- We proposed an end-to-end framework called Med-MICN, which leverages the strength of different XAI methods such as concept-based models, neural symbolic methods, saliency maps, and concept semantics.
- Our outputs are interpreted in multiple dimensions, including concept prediction, saliency maps, and concept reasoning rules, making it easier for experts to identify and correct errors.
- Med-MICN demonstrates superior performance and interpretability compared with other concept-based models and the black-box model baselines.
