<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Here is **Songning Lai (ËµñÈ¢ÇÂÆÅ)**.( You can call me Sony. )

I am a junior student studying in the School of Information Science and Engineering([**Chongxin College**](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B1%B1%E4%B8%9C%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E5%B4%87%E6%96%B0%E5%AD%A6%E5%A0%82/20809738?fr=aladdin)), [**Shandong University**](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/) in China,supervised by Prof. [**Zhi Liu**](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/liuzhi1/zh_CN/index.htm). I am also an incoming PhD student at HKUST@AI Thrust&INFO Hub, supervised by Prof. [**Yutao Yue**](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/YUE-Yutao/yutaoyue).

My research interests are **Explainable AI (XAI)** and **Privacy-preserving AI**. Specifically, my research goal is to build faithful XAI systems which are easily understood by users and are robust in various environments (e.g. **XAI4LLM, XAI4NLP, XAI4MM, XAI4CV, XAI4Security** and so on). I am also interested in applying the XAI to real-world scenarios (e.g. optical systems, recommender systems, and traffic forecasting etc.). At the same time, I am also very interested in the research of AI in the field of **astronomy, environmental science, materials and medicine**.

Prior to this, I have also been exposed to bioinformatics, multimodal sentiment analysis, domain generalization and other research areas.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *songninglai[at]hkust-gz[dot]edu[dot]cn*.

- We proposed an end-to-end framework called Med-MICN, which leverages the strength of different XAI methods such as concept-based models, neural symbolic methods, saliency maps, and concept semantics.
- Our outputs are interpreted in multiple dimensions, including concept prediction, saliency maps, and concept reasoning rules, making it easier for experts to identify and correct errors.
- Med-MICN demonstrates superior performance and interpretability compared with other concept-based models and the black-box model baselines.

- Our research provides faithful technical support and theoretical support to the field of time series forecasting, promising to advance the development and reliability of forecasting methods within the industry. Through these efforts, we aim to bolster the trustworthiness of models, ultimately supporting decision-making processes that rely on accurate and consistent predictions.
