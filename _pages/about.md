Here is **Songning Lai**.( You can call me Sony. )

I received my undergraduate degree from the School of Information Science and Engineering([**Chongxin College**](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B1%B1%E4%B8%9C%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E5%B4%87%E6%96%B0%E5%AD%A6%E5%A0%82/20809738?fr=aladdin)), [**Shandong University**](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/) in China,supervised by Prof. [**Zhi Liu**](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/liuzhi1/zh_CN/index.htm). I am also an incoming PhD student (25 Fall) at HKUST@AI Thrust&INFO Hub, supervised by Prof. [**Yutao Yue**](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/YUE-Yutao/yutaoyue).

My primary research interest lies in the domain of **Trustworthy AI**, encompassing **explainability**, **robustness**, **faithfulness**, and **safety** of AI. Specifically, I have focused extensively on **Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)** within the realm of explainability. My past research includes an investigation into the robustness and generalization of CBMs in unsupervised settings [(ICLR 2024)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rp0EdI8X4e), application of CBMs in multimodal contexts for unsupervised tasks (Under Review), pioneering work on continual learning with CBMs [(Under review)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17471), as well as the first exploration of CBMs in the context of security, particularly backdoor attacks [(Under review 1;](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04823)[ Under review 2)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16512). Furthermore, my research has extended to applying CBMs in medical fields [(NIPS 2024;](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21494) ECML 2025) and autonomous driving applications [(ICRA 2025)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10330).

Beyond my work with CBMs, I have also explored issues related to robustness and faithfulness in time series (ICML 2025; ACM MM 2025), continual learning for time series classification tasks [(Under review)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15954), and image segmentation tasks [(Under review)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10834). Prior to these endeavors, my research efforts were directed towards computer vision ([Image and Vison Computing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0262885623002081); [ICASSP 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03192)), multimodal sentiment analysis ([IJCNN 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.08473); [Displays](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0141938223001968)), and community detection ([Neurocomputing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11798)).

Looking ahead, I am keen on pursuing **Joint** PhD opportunities starting in 2025 FALL (With HKUST(GZ)). My future research aims to delve deeper into **Trustworthy AI** [ICLR24], particularly focusing on **explainability, robustness, faithfulness**, and **safety**, alongside exploring its applications in **AI4Science** [NIPS24], **autonomous driving** [ICRA25;IJCAI25], **Time Series** [ICML25] and **Embodied AI**.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *songninglai[at]hkust-gz[dot]edu[dot]cn*.

The approach consists of initial and semantic-mixed pseudo-label generation phases to enhance the quality of labels and has been open-sourced for public use.

**Enhancing domain adaptation for plant diseases detection through Masked Image Consistency in Multi-Granularity Alignment**

Guinan Guo, **Songning Lai**, Qingyang Wu,, Yuntao Shou, and Wenxu Shi

**Expert Systems With Applications** (JCR Q1 (IF:8.4) CCF C)

This study proposes MIC-MGA, a deep learning approach combining Multi-Granularity Alignment and Masked Image Consistency, to enhance cross-domain generalization in plant disease detection. The method improves object detector architecture while integrating domain adaptation and style-augmented training to address feature distribution shifts across different environmental conditions. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in cross-domain detection tasks (highest mAP), showing significant potential for improving disease prevention and sustainable agriculture.
