Here is <strong>Songning Lai</strong>.( You can call me Sony. )

I received my undergraduate degree from the School of Information Science and Engineering(<a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B1%B1%E4%B8%9C%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E5%B4%87%E6%96%B0%E5%AD%A6%E5%A0%82/20809738?fr=aladdin"><strong>Chongxin College</strong></a>), <a href="https://www.sdu.edu.cn/"><strong>Shandong University</strong></a> in China,supervised by Prof. <a href="https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/liuzhi1/zh_CN/index.htm"><strong>Zhi Liu</strong></a>. I was also an RA at HKUST@AI Thrust&INFO Hub, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/YUE-Yutao/yutaoyue"><strong>Yutao Yue</strong></a>. And now I am a Quant Researcher in <a href="https://www.joinquant.com"><strong>JoinQuant</strong></a>.

My primary research interest lies in the domain of <strong>Trustworthy AI</strong> <span class="icon-emoji">🤖</span>, encompassing <strong>explainability</strong> <span class="icon-emoji">🔍</span>, <strong>robustness</strong> <span class="icon-emoji">🛡️</span>, <strong>faithfulness</strong> <span class="icon-emoji">✅</span>, and <strong>safety</strong> <span class="icon-emoji">🔒</span> of AI. Specifically, I have focused extensively on <strong>Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)</strong> within the realm of explainability. My past research includes an investigation into the robustness and generalization of CBMs in unsupervised settings <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rp0EdI8X4e">(ICLR 2024)</a>, application of CBMs in multimodal contexts for unsupervised tasks (Under Review), pioneering work on continual learning with CBMs <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17471">(ACM MM 2025)</a>, as well as the first exploration of CBMs in the context of security, particularly backdoor attacks <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04823">(Under review 1;</a><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16512"> Under review 2)</a>. Furthermore, my research has extended to applying CBMs in medical fields <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21494">(NIPS 2024;</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05286?">ECML 2025</a>) and autonomous driving applications <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10330">(ICRA 2025)</a>.

Beyond my work with CBMs, I have also explored issues related to robustness and faithfulness in time series (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-TW&user=gRXN-rMAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=gRXN-rMAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC">ICML 2025</a>; <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-TW&user=gRXN-rMAAAAJ&citation_for_view=gRXN-rMAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC">ACM MM 2025</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19656">ICASSP 2026</a>), continual learning<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10834">(ACM MM25)</a> and explainability for LLM (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07896?">ICLR 2026</a>). Prior to these endeavors, my research efforts were directed towards computer vision (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0262885623002081">Image and Vison Computing</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03192">ICASSP 2025</a>), multimodal sentiment analysis (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.08473">IJCNN 2024</a>; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0141938223001968">Displays</a>), and community detection (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11798">Neurocomputing</a>).

<p class="paper-description">In this paper, we propose ACE, a knowledge editing framework based on neuron attribution control. By locating and correcting the key neuron pathways in the Transformer internal inference chain, ACE solves the problem of intermediate implicit subject failure when multi-hop knowledge updating in large language models, and reveals the cognitive mechanism of query neuron driving semantic accumulation.</p>

<strong>[Towards Reliable Time Series Forecasting under Future Uncertainty: Ambiguity and Novelty Rejection Mechanisms]()</strong>

Ninghui Feng†, <strong>Songning Lai†</strong>, Xin Zhou, Jiayu Yang, Kunlong Feng, Zhenxiao Yin, Fobao Zhou, Zhangyi Hu, Yutao Yue, Yuxuan Liang, Boyu Wang, Hang Zhao

The Conference on <strong>ICASSP 2026</strong> <span class="venue-badge ccf-b">CCF B</span> <span class="venue-badge core-a">Core A</span>.

<p class="paper-description">We propose a dual rejection framework combining ambiguity rejection (using prediction error variance) and novelty rejection (leveraging VAEs and Mahalanobis distance) to enhance time series forecasting reliability by abstaining from low-confidence predictions and detecting distribution shifts, effectively reducing errors in dynamic environments. This approach addresses underfitting and out-of-distribution challenges without requiring future ground truth, advancing robust forecasting in complex real-world scenarios.</p>

<p class="paper-description">We introduce Precision-Enhanced Pseudo-Labeling (PEPL), a semi-supervised learning approach for fine-grained image classification that generates and refines pseudo-labels using Class Activation Maps (CAMs) to capture essential details, significantly improving accuracy and robustness over existing methods on benchmark datasets.

<p class="paper-description">We proposed an end-to-end framework called Med-MICN, which leverages the strength of different XAI methods such as concept-based models, neural symbolic methods, saliency maps, and concept semantics. Our outputs are interpreted in multiple dimensions, including concept prediction, saliency maps, and concept reasoning rules, making it easier for experts to identify and correct errors. Med-MICN demonstrates superior performance and interpretability compared with other concept-based models and the black-box model baselines.</p>
