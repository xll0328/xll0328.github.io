Here is **Songning Lai**.( You can call me Sony. )

I received my undergraduate degree from the School of Information Science and Engineering([**Chongxin College**](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B1%B1%E4%B8%9C%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E5%B4%87%E6%96%B0%E5%AD%A6%E5%A0%82/20809738?fr=aladdin)), [**Shandong University**](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/) in China,supervised by Prof. [**Zhi Liu**](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/liuzhi1/zh_CN/index.htm). I was also an RA at HKUST@AI Thrust&INFO Hub, supervised by Prof. [**Yutao Yue**](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/YUE-Yutao/yutaoyue). And now I am a Quant Research Intern in [**JoinQuant**](https://www.joinquant.com), supervised by [**Rui Xiao**](https://dc.simuwang.com/manager/PL00003YUZ.html).

My primary research interest lies in the domain of **Trustworthy AI**, encompassing **explainability**, **robustness**, **faithfulness**, and **safety** of AI. Specifically, I have focused extensively on **Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)** within the realm of explainability. My past research includes an investigation into the robustness and generalization of CBMs in unsupervised settings [(ICLR 2024)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rp0EdI8X4e), application of CBMs in multimodal contexts for unsupervised tasks (Under Review), pioneering work on continual learning with CBMs [(ACM MM 2025)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17471), as well as the first exploration of CBMs in the context of security, particularly backdoor attacks [(Under review 1;](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04823)[ Under review 2)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16512). Furthermore, my research has extended to applying CBMs in medical fields [(NIPS 2024;](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21494) [ECML 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05286?)) and autonomous driving applications [(ICRA 2025)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10330).

Beyond my work with CBMs, I have also explored issues related to robustness and faithfulness in time series ([ICML 2025](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-TW&user=gRXN-rMAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=gRXN-rMAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC); [ACM MM 2025](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-TW&user=gRXN-rMAAAAJ&citation_for_view=gRXN-rMAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC),[ICASSP 2026](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19656)), continual learning[(ACM MM25)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10834) and explainability for LLM ([ICLR 2026](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07896?)). Prior to these endeavors, my research efforts were directed towards computer vision ([Image and Vison Computing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0262885623002081); [ICASSP 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03192)), multimodal sentiment analysis ([IJCNN 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.08473); [Displays](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0141938223001968)), and community detection ([Neurocomputing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11798)).

International Conference on Learning Representations **ICLR2026** (CCF None).

In this paper, we propose ACE, a knowledge editing framework based on neuron attribution control. By locating and correcting the key neuron pathways in the Transformer internal inference chain, ACE solves the problem of intermediate implicit subject failure when multi-hop knowledge updating in large language models, and reveals the cognitive mechanism of query neuron driving semantic accumulation.

The Conference on **ICASSP 2026**(CCF B).

We propose a dual rejection framework combining ambiguity rejection (using prediction error variance) and novelty rejection (leveraging VAEs and Mahalanobis distance) to enhance time series forecasting reliability by abstaining from low-confidence predictions and detecting distribution shifts, effectively reducing errors in dynamic environments. This approach addresses underfitting and out-of-distribution challenges without requiring future ground truth, advancing robust forecasting in complex real-world scenarios.

**Image and Vision Computing** (JCR Q1 (IF:4.7) CCF C)

We propose a Cross-Domain Car Detection Model with an integrated convolutional block Attention mechanism (CDCDMA), featuring a complete cross-domain detection framework, unpaired target domain image generation emphasizing car headlights, GIOU loss function, and a two-headed CBAM, which improved detection performance by 40% over non-CDCDMA models on the SODA 10 M and BDD100K datasets.
