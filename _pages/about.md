Here is **Songning Lai**.( You can call me Sony. )

I am a junior student studying in the School of Information Science and Engineering([**Chongxin College**](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B1%B1%E4%B8%9C%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E5%B4%87%E6%96%B0%E5%AD%A6%E5%A0%82/20809738?fr=aladdin)), [**Shandong University**](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/) in China,supervised by Prof. [**Zhi Liu**](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/liuzhi1/zh_CN/index.htm). I am also an incoming PhD student (25 Fall) at HKUST@AI Thrust&INFO Hub, supervised by Prof. [**Yutao Yue**](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/YUE-Yutao/yutaoyue).

My primary research interest lies in the domain of **Trustworthy AI**, encompassing **explainability**, **robustness**, **faithfulness**, and **safety** of AI. Specifically, I have focused extensively on **Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)** within the realm of explainability. My past research includes an investigation into the robustness and generalization of CBMs in unsupervised settings [(ICLR 2024)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rp0EdI8X4e), application of CBMs in multimodal contexts for unsupervised tasks (Under Review), pioneering work on continual learning with CBMs [(Under review)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17471), as well as the first exploration of CBMs in the context of security, particularly backdoor attacks [(Under review 1;](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04823)[ Under review 2)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16512). Furthermore, my research has extended to applying CBMs in medical fields [(NIPS 2024;](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21494) Under review) and autonomous driving applications [(ICRA 2025)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10330).

Beyond my work with CBMs, I have also explored issues related to robustness and faithfulness in time series (Under review), continual learning for time series classification tasks [(Under review)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15954), and image segmentation tasks [(Under review)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10834). Prior to these endeavors, my research efforts were directed towards computer vision ([Image and Vison Computing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0262885623002081); [ICASSP 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03192)), multimodal sentiment analysis ([IJCNN 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.08473); [Displays](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0141938223001968)), and community detection ([Neurocomputing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11798)).

Looking ahead, I am keen on pursuing **Joint** PhD opportunities starting in 2025 FALL (With HKUST(GZ)). My future research aims to delve deeper into **Trustworthy AI**, particularly focusing on **explainability, robustness, faithfulness**, and **safety**, alongside exploring its applications in **AI4Science**, especially in the **biological** and **medical sectors**.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *songninglai[at]hkust-gz[dot]edu[dot]cn*.

Haozhe Jia, Wenshuo Chen, Zhihui Huang, Hongru Xiao, Nanqian Jia, Keming Wu, **Songning Lai**, Yutao Yue

Radio map reconstruction is essen- tial for enabling advanced applications, yet chal- lenges such as complex signal propagation and sparse data hinder accurate reconstruction. To ad- dress these issues, we propose the Radio Map Diffusion Model (RMDM), a physics-informed framework that integrates Physics-Informed Neu- ral Networks (PINNs) to incorporate constraints like the Helmholtz equation. RMDM employs a dual U-Net architecture: the first ensures physical consistency by minimizing PDE residuals, bound- ary conditions, and source constraints, while the second refines predictions via diffusion-based de- noising. By leveraging physical laws, RMDM sig- nificantly enhances accuracy, robustness, and gen- eralization.

Rapid progress in text-to-motion generation has been largely driven by diffusion models. However, existing methods focus solely on temporal modeling, thereby overlooking frequency-domain analysis. We identify two key phases in motion denoising: the **semantic planning stage** and the **fine-grained improving stage**. To address these phases effectively, we propose **Fre**quency **e**nhanced **t**ext-**to**-**m**otion diffusion model (**Free-T2M**), incorporating stage-specific consistency losses that enhance the robustness of static features and improve fine-grained accuracy.

**[Learning New Concepts, Remembering the Old: A Novel Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17471)**

Songning Lai, Mingqian Liao, Zhangyi Hu, Jiayu Yang, Wenshuo Chen, Yutao Yue

To enhance Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) for evolving data streams, we propose CONceptual Continual Incremental Learning (CONCIL), a framework that accumulates new concepts and classes while preventing catastrophic forgetting. CONCIL reformulates updates as linear regression problems, eliminating gradient-based updates and requiring only recursive matrix operations, ensuring computational efficiency. Suitable for real-time and large-scale applications, CONCIL achieves "absolute knowledge memory" and outperforms traditional CBMs in concept- and class-incremental settings, setting new benchmarks for continual learning.

This paper introduces Selective Task Arithmetic (STA), a training-free framework enhancing multi-task performance via task-specific parameter fusion. STA addresses parameter importance diversity using a loss-sensitive metric from a first-order Taylor expansion, reduces over-reliance on hyperparameter tuning by improving task vector sparsity, and mitigates task forgetting more effectively by leveraging parameter importance to minimize noisy elements, improving model generalization and robustness.

Ruiqiang Xiao‚Ä†, **Songning Lai‚Ä†**, Yijun Yang, Jiemin Wu, Yutao Yue, Lei Zhu


To address challenges in Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA), we propose DRIVE, a dual-model framework leveraging mutual information and entropy. DRIVE uses two identically initialized models; one is perturbed via PGD guided by mutual information to focus on high-uncertainty regions, while an entropy-aware pseudo-labeling strategy adjusts label weights based on prediction uncertainty. DRIVE's two-stage adaptation process first aligns models on stable features using mutual information consistency loss, then dynamically adjusts perturbation levels to enhance generalization and robustness. Evaluations show DRIVE outperforms existing methods in adaptation accuracy and stability across complex domains.

To tackle catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental time series pattern recognition, we propose TS-ACL, a privacy-preserving, gradient-free continual learning framework. TS-ACL uses a pre-trained frozen encoder for embedding extraction and updates an analytic classifier recursively with a closed-form solution, avoiding catastrophic forgetting without storing historical data. This lightweight approach ensures non-forgetting, privacy preservation, and efficiency, suitable for edge computing. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods.
