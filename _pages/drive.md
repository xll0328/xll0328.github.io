## Abstract

Recent advancements in autonomous driving have seen a paradigm shift towards end-to-end learning paradigms, which map sensory inputs directly to driving actions, enhancing robustness and adaptability. However, these models often sacrifice interpretability, posing challenges to trust, safety, and regulatory compliance. We introduce **DRIVE** — **D**ependable **R**obust **I**nterpretable **V**isionary **E**nsemble Framework in Autonomous Driving, a comprehensive framework designed to improve the dependability and stability of explanations in end-to-end unsupervised autonomous driving models. Our work targets the inherent instability problems observed in the Driving through the Concept Gridlock (DCG) model. We define four key attributes of **DRIVE**: consistent interpretability, stable interpretability, consistent output, and stable output, ensuring that explanations remain reliable and robust across scenarios and perturbations. Through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and provide novel metrics for evaluating the dependability of concept-based explainable autonomous driving models.
